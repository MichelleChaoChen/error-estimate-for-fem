# Draft Feedback

### General Feedback
- Front and end is incomplete
- What to put: 
	- add citations, some methods should be specified: zz?
	- should be something that all of us can follow
	- some implementation, basic of nn, before 3.1
	- we can start some implementation
- conclusion:
	- what we found
	- research gaps
	- what is the timeline - 
	- how does fem and nn interface
- can mention specific facts relevant to our project in both the body and conclusion
- abstract, not necessary
- intro:
	- also mention general motivation 
	- mention the big problems
- goal: we want refined mesh as output
- be precise when it will be used
- keep it general when its for inspiration
- don't copy directly in verbatim, counts as fraud
- add quotes ^

### Content Feedback
- stay away from rnn because
	1. global
	2. figures the whole sequence of mesh, too much work
- emphasize: use of local error estimates
- define all notations prior to the section
- add figure & eqn for nn
- add a book for details that are skipped


### General Suggestions
1. what kind of data is relevant? (conclusion)
2. for each method, is it too difficult, do we want to try it in a modified form?
- summary of classical methods (relevant to us)
- computational cost vs. accuracy
