Solves 1D Poisson problem -u_xx = f,
x in [0, 1], with Dirichlet B.C.s u(0)=0, u(1)=0.
Alternatively, Neumann BC: u(0)=0, u_x(1) = q
Uses hat linear basis functions.

For this problem the Galerkin method will be nodally exact following 
[The finite element method : linear static and dynamic finite element analysis]. 

Extensions:
-Different problem.
-Maybe trig source functions.
